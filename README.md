# shc-web-verifier
Web application for verifying SMART Health Cards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Client-side CDC CDSi validator

Limited scope, CQL engine based client-side validation script that executes the CDSi supporting data guidelines.

Currently only validates each non-Risk type series based on allowable series age to start, dose absMinAge, allowable vaccine codes (CVX only) and begin/end age, and allowableInterval absMinInt fromPrevious.

Does not support forecasting or any other validation, including conditional doses, recurring or seasonal doses, immunity or contradictions.

### Update CQL library

Script to convert CQL to ELM and write results to src/output-elm. Requires Docker to be running locally.

```
docker run --name cql-translation-service --rm -d -p 8080:8080 cqframework/cql-translation-service:latest
yarn translate
```

### Update CDSi supporting data

Script to convert CDSi AntigenSupportingData XML format to json and write results to src/supporting-data.

`node ./src/supporting-data/SupportingData.js '/path/to/CDC/Version x.xx - 508/XML/AntigenSupportingData- COVID-19-508.xml'`

Will need to be updated with each CDSi release. Primary vaccine series number of doses are defined separately in src/supporting-data/AncilarySupportingData-{antigen}.json
